### Proof of Concept

![5FAN Demo - Context-Aware Empathetic Support](screenshots/5fan-demo.png)
*5FAN responding with contextually appropriate empathy: hear, inspyre, flow, you, and view voices providing multi-layered psychological support in real-time*

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- ✅ Multiple AI voices responding to the same input with distinct perspectives
- ✅ Context-aware sentiment detection (challenging vs. positive messages)
- ✅ 3-6 second natural response timing
- ✅ P2P architecture simulation (entry channel: 0000intercom)
- ✅ 394 unique empathetic responses across 5 personalities

## What is 5FAN?

5FAN is a **P2P empathetic AI agent** that listens to messages on the Intercom network and responds with compassion, inspiration, and perspective. It features **five distinct voices**, each with a unique personality:

1. **Hear** - Empathetic listener that validates feelings and offers reflective support
2. **Inspyre** - Motivational coach providing encouragement and forward momentum
3. **Flow** - Zen guide promoting calm, presence, and mindful awareness
4. **You** - Self-love advocate celebrating personal worth and achievements
5. **View** - Perspective shifter offering alternative viewpoints and reframing

### AI-Powered & Resilient

5FAN integrates **Ollama (llama3.2:3b)** for contextually-aware AI responses that adapt to conversation tone and content. When Ollama is unavailable, it gracefully falls back to **394 pre-written empathetic responses** across all five voices, ensuring reliable operation.

### Built on Intercom

5FAN extends [Trac Network's Intercom](https://github.com/trac-network/tracr-intercom-v1), a P2P reference implementation for an "internet of agents". Features:
- **Sidechannels**: Fast, ephemeral P2P messaging (no central server)
- **HyperDHT + Hyperswarm**: Direct peer-to-peer discovery and communication
- **SC-Bridge**: WebSocket control surface for agent integration
- **MSB integration**: Optional value-settled transactions

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 22.x/23.x, [Pear runtime](https://docs.pears.com/guides/getting-started), optional [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)

**Install & Run:**
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/joeatang/5FAN.git
cd 5FAN
npm install

# Optional: Install Ollama for AI-powered responses
# ollama pull llama3.2:3b

# Terminal 1 - Admin peer
pear run . --peer-store-name admin --msb-store-name admin_msb \
  --dht-bootstrap "node1.hyperdht.org:49737,node2.hyperdht.org:49737"

# Terminal 2 - Second peer
pear run . --peer-store-name peer2 --msb-store-name peer2_msb \
  --dht-bootstrap "node1.hyperdht.org:49737,node2.hyperdht.org:49737"

# In both terminals, join the entry channel
join 0000intercom

# Send a message - 5FAN will respond in 3-6 seconds!
send Hello world
```

**See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for complete setup and troubleshooting.**

## How It Works

When you send a message on the `0000intercom` channel, 5FAN:
1. **Listens** via Intercom's P2P sidechannel messaging
2. **Selects** one of five voices randomly
3. **Generates** a contextual response using Ollama AI (or falls back to pre-written responses)
4. **Responds** after 3-6 seconds with empathy and insight
5. **Broadcasts** back to the P2P network - all peers see the response

### Response Strategy
- **AI Mode** (Ollama detected): Contextual responses using each voice's personality prompt
- **Fallback Mode** (no Ollama): 394 unique pre-written responses ensure reliability
- **Timing**: 3-6 second delays create natural, thoughtful conversation pacing

---

## Architecture

5FAN runs as a single long-running Pear process built on Intercom's three networking "planes":
- **Subnet plane**: Deterministic state replication (Autobase/Hyperbee over Hyperswarm/Protomux)
- **Sidechannel plane**: Fast ephemeral messaging (Hyperswarm/Protomux) - **where 5FAN listens & responds**
- **MSB plane**: Optional value-settled transactions (Peer -> MSB client -> validator network)

## Development Notes

**Core Files:**
- [`index.js`](index.js) - Main Intercom entry point with 5FAN message handler (lines 510-580)
- [`ai-helper.js`](ai-helper.js) - Ollama integration with Node.js http module + fallback logic
- [`5 voices/`](5%20voices/) - Five voice modules with personality-driven responses

**Modifications from Base Intercom:**
- Custom `onMessage` handler routes sidechannel messages to 5FAN voices
- Async/await pattern for AI response generation
- Ollama detection at startup (shows "🤖 5FAN AI Mode" or "📝 5FAN Fallback Mode")
- Detailed logging with [AI], [Fallback], [5FAN] prefixes

**Troubleshooting:**
- Kill stuck processes: `pkill -9 -f pear-runtime`
- Clean lock files: `find stores -name "LOCK" -delete`
- Use separate `--peer-store-name` for each peer to avoid conflicts
- Ollama must run at `localhost:11434` (install separately)
