# Intercom

This repository is a reference implementation of the **Intercom** stack on Trac Network for the agentic internet.  
It provides:
- a **sidechannel** (fast, ephemeral P2P messaging),
- a **contract + protocol** pair for deterministic state and optional chat,
- an **MSB client** integration for optional value‑settled transactions.

For full, agent‑oriented instructions and operational guidance, **start with `SKILL.md`**.  
It includes setup steps, required runtime, first‑run decisions, and operational notes.

## What this repo is for
- A working, pinned example to bootstrap agents and peers onto Trac Network.
- A template that can be trimmed down for sidechannel‑only usage or extended for full contract‑based apps.

## How to use
Use the **Pear runtime only** (never native node).  
Follow the steps in `SKILL.md` to install dependencies, run the admin peer, and join peers correctly.

## Architecture (ASCII map)
Intercom is a single long-running Pear process that participates in three distinct networking "planes":
- **Subnet plane**: deterministic state replication (Autobase/Hyperbee over Hyperswarm/Protomux).
- **Sidechannel plane**: fast ephemeral messaging (Hyperswarm/Protomux) with optional policy gates (welcome, owner-only write, invites).
- **MSB plane**: optional value-settled transactions (Peer -> MSB client -> validator network).

  Optional for local testing:
  - --dht-bootstrap "<host:port,host:port>" overrides the peer's HyperDHT bootstraps
    (all peers that should discover each other must use the same list).

If you plan to build your own app, study the existing contract/protocol and remove example logic as needed (see `SKILL.md`).
